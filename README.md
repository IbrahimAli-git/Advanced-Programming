## Project Description

For this module's assignment I was tasked with building a console-based vehicle rental application.
This was to be done using the advance programming techniques I was taught in the lessons
and given further instruction on in the tutorials. The resulting application is to allow users to interact with the application and
add vehicles to the system, remove them, search for them, and sort them by registration number and cost per day

## How to install and run the Program:

1. First ensure that C++ is installed on one's computer. 
2. Next ensure that Visual Studio is installed on one's computer.
3. Start Visual Studio and clone the project in it.
4. Run main.cpp
